* GRASP: The GRAphical Scheme Programming

This is the repository of the GRASP project, which
is intended to be an extensible editor of s-expressions
optimized for interacting via touch screen.

*NOTE* This repository is archived.
The development of GRASP now takes place on
[[https://github.com/panicz/grasp]].

The most mature build of the prototype for Android
is probably the one from [[https://github.com/panicz/grasp-android/raw/b0a2a0875810d0b03aae076370db62d9f4e5e08e/stages/stage6/org.scheme.GRASP.apk][September 30, 2021]]

A brief overview of the current capabilities of GRASP were
presented in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlOghAlCDA4][this lightning talk from 2021 Scheme Workshop]].
However, the application shown in the presentation didn't yet
allow to evaluate expressions (so it corresponds to the stage 5 build).

Expression evaluation is briefly shown in [[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oOHg74HYau4][this video]].

A full-blown demo in front of a live audience was also recorded
and is available [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGba4J-ThEk][here]], 
but it is in Polish, so it's unlikely that you'll find it useful
if you don't speak that language.

Currently the work mainly happens in the `stages/retreat/GRASP` directory.
It is a new prototype, written from the ground up in Kawa Scheme.
It doesn't work on Android yet - currently it can only be run in a terminal
(it uses a Java curses-like library called "lanterna" - a `.jar` is in
included the repo).

But the plan is to support both Android and terminals, and also build
a graphical client for the desktop.
